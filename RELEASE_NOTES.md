# Release Notes

This section contains past updates we've sent to customers via Discord.

## 1.0.2 (April 18, 2024)

- 🍢 Fix a kebab-casing issue with Android Flavors
- 📝 Include Flutter version in patch command logs

📚 Release notes can be found at https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/releases/tag/v1.0.2

## 1.0.1 (April 17, 2024)

- 🚀 Improve link percentage by ~10-15% for all iOS patches
- 🩹 Fix potentially incorrect behavior in optimized try/catch on iOS patches
- 🥞 Fix potential crashes when using dwarf stack traces on iOS patches
- 🖇️ Fix potential errors on iOS patches due to link table alignment bug in the snapshot
- 💥 Fix issue where patching a release with multiple platforms built with different flutter versions would crash.
- 🪵 Improve logs to only include stack traces when using `--verbose`
- 🔍 Fix issue where `shorebird init` would not find a `pubspec.yaml` due to malformed values
- ❅ Fix flaky failures when encoding archives (observed in `shorebird preview` on Windows)
- 📝 Include patch instructions after all `release` commands
- 🔗 Link to the Shorebird Console when a release already exists
- 🚉 Support `--target-platforms` on android release and patch commands
- 🍧 Fix `shorebird release android` with camelCase flavor names

This is a required upgrade due to the issue present in all previous `shorebird`
versions where it was possible to create invalid (crashing) patches if the same
release number was used for multiple platforms but built with different Flutter
versions.

Please upgrade using `shorebird upgrade`.

## 1.0.0 (April 8, 2024)

🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 It's here! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉

We’re excited to announce Shorebird 1.0, including stable support for iOS!

🚀 iOS is production-ready!

📚 Release notes can be found at https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/releases/tag/v1.0.0

## 1.0.0-rc.1 (April 4, 2024)

- ⭐ Fix sync\* to be much faster on iOS.
- 🚫 Removed deprecated (error-prone) --force flag from `shorebird release` and `shorebird patch`.

This release contains all fixes we intended for 1.0. Unless any critical bugs
come in in the next few days, we will release 1.0 next Monday!

Removed support for creating new iOS releases with Flutter versions older than 3.19.5 in `shorebird release ios`
since those versions contain the "beta" and "alpha" iOS engines. Patching
is still possible for any existing iOS releases.

📚 Release notes can be found at https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.1

## 0.28.1 (April 3, 2024)

- 🐦 Support for Flutter 3.19.5
- 💥 Fix iOS crash when booting from patch due to a bug in our canonical pc implementation
- 🛣️ Fix hang when creating release with Fastlane
- 💬 Suggest re-running command with --verbose on failure
- 🍦 Detect flavors when running `shorebird preview` for better prompting (@erickzanardo's first contribution! 🎉)

📚 Release notes can be found at https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/releases/tag/v0.28.1

## 0.28.0 (March 28, 2024)

🚀 Apps with a patch applied on iOS run much faster than previously.
💾 `shorebird release` saves XCode Version and OS to console.shorebird.dev
to help diagnose any later issues during patching.

Shorebird's Flutter 3.19.4 contains a re-write of our Dart build pipeline on iOS
which eliminates any slowdowns caused by patching Dart code in most cases. We
built a new mechanism to make patched code build much more similarly to
unpatched code, thus allowing more code sharing between the "patch" and
"release" builds resulting in much faster execution at runtime.

Most patches on iOS should now run at speeds indistinguishable from releases.
If the toolchain detects a case where the patch will run slower, it will
provide a warning. If you see any of these warnings, please let us know!

Note: `shorebird patch ios` now takes a little longer as it has to do
more work when building a patch.

This is probably our last iOS beta before we declare Shorebird Code Push 1.0.
We still have one more slowdown for unpatched builds we need to fix, but we
expect that to only take a couple days and be ready for a 1.0 next week.

📚 Release notes can be found at https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/releases/tag/v0.27.2

## 0.27.1 (March 22, 2024)

🪟 Automatically detects a CI environment when running on an Azure pipeline.
👀 Fixes a bug in `shorebird preview` where the command could fail if Flutter
had not downloaded the necessary dependencies.

📚 Release notes can be found at https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/releases/tag/v0.27.1

## 0.27.0 (March 21, 2024)

🛑 Removes support for the `--force` flag for release and patch commands (see below)
🚢 Adds --export-options-plist option to `patch ios` command.
🤖 Fixes an issue where some Android builds were not able to find release
artifacts due to a change in the artifact output location (see
https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/1798).

If you have previously used the `--force` flag for release or patch commands, now
is a good time to revisit whether this is necessary. `--force` is _not_ required
to run Shorebird on CI. If your patches include **known good** native code and/or
asset changes, you can use `--allow-native-diffs` and/or `--allow-asset-diffs`
as an argument to the patch command to bypass warnings. We caution against these,
however, as native code or asset changes can cause crashes or other issues in
your app.

If you have any questions about this change, please feel free to reach out!

Apple's privacy requirements. Note: this changes the workflow for iOS hybrid
apps that use Shorebird. If you have an iOS hybrid app, please see the updated
documentation at https://docs.shorebird.dev/guides/hybrid-app/ios.

📚 Release notes can be found at https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/releases/tag/v0.26.6

## 0.26.5 (March 13, 2024)

🩹 Fix issue where releases created with `--flutter-version` flag were reporting
incorrect Flutter version, causing `shorebird patch` to later fail. If you've
created a release using `--flutter-version`, you may not be able to patch.
To resolve this, create a new release after upgrading to this version.

📚 Release notes can be found at https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/releases/tag/v0.26.5

📚 Release notes can be found at https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/releases/tag/v0.26.2

## 0.26.1 (February 28, 2024)

🆕 Updated to Flutter 3.19.2.
🪟 Fixed `shorebird patch` failing on some Windows installs (missing .dll).
☁️ Added Microsoft login to `shorebird login`, `shorebird login:ci`, and
console.shorebird.dev.

Microsoft login will show Shorebird as an "unverified" app for a few more
days until our Microsoft Partner Program application completes.

📚 Release notes can be found at https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/releases/tag/v0.26.1

## 0.26.0 (February 15, 2024)

🆕 Updated to Flutter 3.19.0.
🗑 Deprecated `flutter versions use` in favor of `shorebird release --flutter-version`.
💥 Fixed a crash on iOS involving package:dio.

The iOS crasher was caused by a subtle bug in the upstream Dart dill compiler,
triggered by code in `package:dio`, which only executed when parsing json blobs
larger than 50kb. The full fix required changes to upstream Dart which is why
we waited until Flutter 3.19.0 to release this fix.

We're now returning our focus to finishing 1.0. We believe this release to be
stable and safe to use on iOS and Android. Please let us know if you encounter
any issues!

📚 Release notes can be found at https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/releases/tag/v0.26.0

## 0.25.2 (February 7, 2024)

💥 Fixes a crash on iOS releases without a patch.
🚑 Now publishing .dSYM files for iOS builds to help with crash reporting, see
https://docs.shorebird.dev/guides/crash-reporting for usage instructions.
🪵 Fixed logs from Shorebird updater not appearing on iOS.

We have received multiple reports of iOS builds crashing at 0xfffffffffffffffe.
https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/1700
We expect this is a bug in our new iOS engine relating to `async`/`await`, but
have not yet been able to reproduce this ourselves. We would _love_ to work
with you to debug this issue if you are seeing it.

If you see any issues, please let us know!

📚 Release notes can be found at https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/releases/tag/v0.24.1

## 0.24.0 (January 30, 2024)

This is our last planned release before iOS beta. We believe iOS is stable
enough for general use. We plan to release beta later this week once we hear
back from early adopters. iOS releases and patches are still slower than
Android, but they will continue to get faster in the coming weeks.

Please test and let us know if you encounter any issues!

- iOS patches now run ~2x faster.
- Fixed several crashers in the new iOS engine.
- `shorebird -v` now shows all output from underlying commands, not just errors.

## 0.23.0 (January 24, 2024)

This release includes a new iOS "linker" which allows running much more code on
the CPU when patching on iOS. Some benchmarks improved 10-50x. We still have
work to do before we declare 1.0, but we're very close now.

This release contains fundamental changes as to how Dart executes and may
still have instabilities we failed to catch in our testing.

We recommend Shorebird users test apps and patches before distributing to users.
`shorebird preview` can be used to test patches before releasing to users:
https://docs.shorebird.dev/guides/staging-patches

If you encounter problems, you can release with an older (known stable) iOS
engine by running: `shorebird flutter versions use 3.16.4`

- 🚀 Enabled new linker on iOS, improving Dart execution after patching.

Known issues:

- Obfuscated iOS builds fail to patch:
  https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/1619
- Unpatched iOS builds are sometimes _slower_ than patched builds:

- 🏃 Made `shorebird preview` faster on Android.
- 🔍 Fixed sometimes failing to find `adb` on Windows.

Note: Moving to Dart 3 is breaking. Dart 3 is not able to build apps that run

to Shorebird 0.2.0, you will not be able to push patches to releases made with
Shorebird 0.1.0 or earlier. You will need to make a new release with Shorebird
0.2.0 to be able to push patches from Shorebird 0.2.0.

We can add support for multiple Flutter versions in the future:

📚 Changelog

## 0.0.10

We've just released Shorebird CLI v0.0.10.

We discovered a bug in 0.0.9 that caused releases made from 0.0.9 with
a version name including build number (e.g. `1.0.0+1`) to fail to update.

`shorebird release` would include the build number in the version name,
but the updater client would not include the build number in its request
to the server.

The fix was to make the updater client always also include the build number
which will make "1.0.0+1" and "1.0.0+2" correctly different versions.

What else is new:

- `shorebird run` now supports `-d` to specify a device ID.
- Fixed `shorebird run` on linux x64 when `web` was enabled for the project.
- Fixed Windows install script to work even when IE was not installed.
- Fixed Windows install to add the correct path to the PATH variable.

As always, you can upgrade with `shorebird upgrade`.

Please let us know if we can help!

## 0.0.9 - Open Beta

Welcome to 0.0.9, big changes ahead!

If you're already using Shorebird, you can upgrade to the latest version
with `shorebird upgrade`.

It no longer requires an invite to use Shorebird. You can create and account
and subscribe to the Open Beta directly from the command line. Instructions
are available at our new docs site: https://docs.shorebird.dev/

What's new:

- New site: https://shorebird.dev/ and docs site: https://docs.shorebird.dev/
- Windows support! https://docs.shorebird.dev now has instructions on how
  to install Shorebird on Windows.
- Updates no longer block launch. When available, updates are still applied
  during app launch, but now on a background thread. This means that your
  development flow to test your patches will involve launching your app
  letting it update in the background, and then re-launching to see the patch
  applied. This change was made to improve the experience for users
  (there is no longer a synchronous network request during app startup) and
  make apps resilient to unreliable networks during launch.

As always, please let us know if you see any issues.

## Announcement for 0.0.8

We've just released Shorebird CLI v0.0.8 🎉

What's new:

- Updated to Flutter 3.7.12.
- Updated Shorebird to use a specific revision of Flutter (rather than
  "latest stable in our fork", making it possible to check out a specific
  version of Shorebird from git and expect it to be able to build binaries
  even months in the future).
- Added (partial) support for Android build numbers.
- Added `shorebird account create` and `shorebird account subscribe` to
  automate our onboarding process for new trusted testers.
- Improved the way we proxy Flutter artifacts (via download.shorebird.dev) to
  greatly improve our speed of releasing new versions of Shorebird.

Let us know if you see any issues!

## Announcement for 0.0.7

We've just released Shorebird CLI v0.0.7 🎉

What's new:

- Fixed our backend to not error for large app releases.
- `shorebird build` is now split into two subcommands:
  - `shorebird build apk` (new)
  - `shorebird build appbundle` (previously `shorebird build`)

Changelog: https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/releases/tag/v0.0.7

## Announcement for 0.0.6

We're happy to announce Shorebird 0.0.6!

Shorebird should be ready for production apps < 10k users.

You should be able to get test latest via `shorebird upgrade`

What's new:

- Fixed updates to apply when app installed with apk splits (as the Play
  Store does by default). This was our last known production blocking issue.
- `shorebird subscription cancel` now is able to cancel your monthly
  Shorebird subscription. Your Shorebird account will keep working until
  the end of your billing period. After expiration, your apps will continue
  to function normally, just will no longer pull updates from Shorebird.
- `shorebird cache clean` (Thanks @TypicalEgg!) will now clear Shorebird
  caches.
- Install script now pulls down artifacts as part of install.
- Continued improvements to our account handling in preparation for supporting
  self-sign-up.

Known issues:

- Shorebird is still using Flutter 3.7.10. We will update to 3.7.11 right
  after this release:
  https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/305
- Shorebird does not yet support Android versionCode, only versionName.
  https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/291

Please try shorebird in production and let us know how we can help!

## Announcement for 0.0.5

We're happy to announce Shorebird 0.0.5!

TL;DR: Shorebird should be ready for use in production for apps < 10k users.

You should be able to get the latest via `shorebird upgrade`.

What's new:

- Updates should now apply consistently (previously sometimes failed).
  https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/235. This was our
  last-known production-blocking issue.
- `shorebird doctor` and other commands now are a bit more robust in
  their checks.
- We did a ton of backend work (which shouldn't be visible), mostly
  in terms of testing to make sure we're ready for production. We also
  integrated our backend with Stripe (to make subscription management
  possible).

Known issues:

- Shorebird is still using Flutter 3.7.10. We will update to 3.7.11
  in the next couple days. We've done the previous Flutter updates
  manually, but we're working on automating updates so that Shorebird
  can track Flutter versions as soon as minutes after they are released.
  https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/236

You can see what we're tracking for 0.0.6 here:
https://github.com/orgs/shorebirdtech/projects/6/views/1

We've also wired up Stripe integration on the backend and will have some
subscription management (including ability to cancel) in our next release.

We expect you all will have requests as you try Shorebird in production
please don't hesitate to let us know! We're standing by to fix/add what
you need to help you be successful.

Please try shorebird in production and let us know how we can help!

Eric

## Announcement for 0.0.4

I'm happy to announce shorebird 0.0.4!

This one's a big one. Unfortunately it's also breaking.

You will both need to re-install shorebird and re-login to shorebird:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.shorebird
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shorebirdtech/install/main/install.sh -sSf | sh
```

Then you'll want to `shorebird login` and follow the prompts to authenticate
with a Google account.

We believe we've updated our database to mark all trusted testers as paid
accounts after the auth migration, but if you see any issues, please let us
know, and we'll be happy to fix your account right away.

What's new:

- `shorebird` supports Android 32-bit and 64-bit devices!
- `shorebird` works on Linux and Mac-Intel hosts!
- `shorebird login` uses Google OAuth instead of API keys.
- `shorebird doctor` does some basic validation.
- `shorebird account` shows your login status.
- Updated to Flutter 3.7.10.
- We also automated our builds of the Shorebird engine.
  While that won't affect your usage, it did make this release
  possible and will allow us to keep up to date with Flutter more easily as
  well as removing a source of human error in our processes.

As part of adding support for Android arm32 devices as well as Linux and
Mac-Intel hosts, we've changed how `shorebird` uses Flutter. Previously it used
the Flutter SDK already installed on your machine. Now it brings its own copy
of `flutter`. This is due to the fact that our previous method of replacing the
Flutter engine binaries on Android went in through a (hacky) development-only
path, which only supported only a single architecture at a time (hence us
previously limiting `shorebird` only 64-bit Android devices).

Now we use a fork of Flutter. The only change in our fork is the engine version
it tries to fetch. When `shorebird` runs our forked `flutter`, we also tell it
to fetch its engine artifacts from our server (download.shorebird.dev) instead
of Google's (download.flutter.io). download.shorebird.dev knows how to replace
a few Android artifacts with Shorebird enabled ones and proxy all other requests
to Google's servers. This is how we now support all platforms Flutter does
since it's using the same host binaries as an unmodified Flutter SDK.

https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/blob/main/FORKING_FLUTTER.md has more
information on how we forked Flutter if you're curious.

Known issues:

- We have had reports of patches sometimes failing to apply. We expect to have
  a fix for this early next week.
  https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/235
- Shorebird itself should work on Windows, but we haven't updated our installer
  script to support it yet. https://github.com/shorebirdtech/install/issues/10

Please try out the new platforms and new auth flow and let us know what you
think.
