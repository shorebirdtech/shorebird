# Trusted Testers

While this document is public, access to Shorebird services are not yet
generally available. We're running a trusted tester program with a limited
number of users to ensure that we're building the right thing and that it's
stable for general use.

If you'd like to be a part of the program, please join our mailing list
(linked from shorebird.dev), we will send out information there as we're ready.


## Welcome!

If you're joining the trusted tester program, welcome!  Thank you for your help
making Shorebird a reality.

You should have received an API key in the mail.  You will need it as part
of the login process for the `shorebird` command-line tool to work.

## Our goal

Our goal with this Trusted Tester program is to shake out bugs and ensure that
we are building things people want.  We *want* your feedback.  We *want* you to
break things.  We *want* you to tell us what you want to see next.  We're
already a default-public company, but we intend to be even more open with you
and will be shipping your regular updates during the program, responding to
your feedback.

Our guiding principle in creating v1 has been "first, do no harm".  It should be
the case that using Shorebird is never worse than not using Shorebird.  We've
worked hard to find and remove breaking bugs, but I'm sure we've missed some.

It is still possible using Shorebird may break your app in the wild.  Thankfully
this is no worse than any other change to your app, and you can always push a
new version via the store should Shorebird break users in the wild.

## What works today
You can build and deploy new (release) versions of your app to all Android arm64
users via Shorebird command line from a Mac computer.

All users will synchronously update to the new version on next launch
(no control over this behavior yet).

Basic access to the updater through package:dart_bindings (unpublished).
https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/tree/main/updater/dart_bindings

Shorebird command line can show a list of what apps and app versions you've
associated with your account and what patches you've pushed to those apps.
https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/tree/main/packages/shorebird_cli

Updates are currently typically a few MBs in size and include all Dart code that
your app uses (we can make this much smaller, but haven't yet).

## What doesn't yet

Limited platform support:
* Only Arm64 platform, no non-Android or non-arm64 support.
* Windows, Linux

No support for:
* Flutter channels (only latest stable is supported)
* Rollbacks
* Shorebird channels (staged rollouts of patches)
* Percentage based rollouts
* Async updates / downloads
* Analytics
* Web interface
* CI/CD (GitHub Actions, etc.) integration
* Patch signing
* Sign-in via something other than an API key (e.g. OAuth)

## Installing Shorebird command line

The first thing you'll want to do is install the `shorebird` command-line tool.

```bash
# Clone the Shorebird repo
git clone https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird

# Activate the Shorebird CLI
dart pub global activate --source path shorebird/packages/shorebird_cli
```

More information: https://github.com/shorebirdtech/install/blob/main/README.md

Currently we assume you have `flutter` installed and working.  We also require
that `flutter` be set to the latest stable channel.  The `shorebird` tool should
enforce this (and show errors if your `flutter` is not set up as expected).


## Using Shorebird code push

The first use-case we're targeting is one of deploying updates to a small
set of users.  If you already have a Flutter app with a small install base, you
can convert it to Shorebird in a few steps:

1. Use `shorebird init` to add a `shorebird.yaml` file to your project.
`shorebird.yaml` contains the app_id for your app, which is just a unique
identifier the app will be able to send to Shorebird servers to identify which
application/developer to pull updates from.

`shorebird init` will also add the `shorebird.yaml` to the assets section of
your `pubspec.yaml` file, which will ensure that the file is included in your
app's assets.

You can go ahead and commit these changes, they will be innocuous even if you
don't end up using Shorebird with this application.

2.  Typical development usage will involve normal `flutter` commands.  Only
when you go to build the final release version of you app, do you need to use
the `shorebird` command-line tool.

## Building a release version of your app

When you're ready to publish your app (either to a store or just side-loaded
onto your local Android device) use `shorebird build` to build a release version
of your app including the Shorebird updater.

You can also use `shorebird run` to build and run your app on a connected
Android device, again in release mode.

To publish a patch to your app, use `shorebird publish`.  This will take the
currently build version of your app and upload it to the Shorebird servers for
distribution to all other copies of your app.

The current `shorebird publish` flow is not how we envison Shorebird being used
longer term (e.g one might push a git hash to a CI/CD system, which would
then publish it to Shorebird).  However, it's the simplest thing to do for now.

Note that you can only publish a patch to an app that you have already told
shorebird about:
https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/tree/main/packages/shorebird_cli#create-app

Your applications in the wild will query for updates with their app_id
(which comes from shorebird.yaml) and their release version (which comes from
AndroidManifest.xml, which in turn is generated from pubspec.yaml).

## Update behavior

The Shorebird updater is currently hard-coded to update synchronously on
launch.  This means that when you push a new version of your app, all users
will update on next launch.

We expect to add more control over update behavior in the future, including
async updates and percentage based rollouts.  Please let us know if these
are important to you and we are happy to prioritize them!

The Shorebird updater is designed such that when the network is not available,
or the server is down or otherwise unreachable, the app will continue to run
as normal.  Should you ever chose to delete an update from our servers, all your
clients will continue to run as normal.

We have not yet added the ability to rollback patches, but it's on our todo
list and happy to prioritize it if it's important to you.  For now, the simplest
thing is to simply push a new patch that reverts the changes you want to undo.

## Permissions needed for Shorebird

Shorebird code push requires the Network permission to be added to your
`AndroidManifest.xml` file.  This is required for the app to be able to
communicate with the Shorebird servers.

```xml
<manifest ...>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
    ...
</manifest>
```

## Play Store

Although Shorebird connects to the network, it does not send any personally
identifiable information.  Including Shorebird should not affect your
declarations for the Play Store.

Requests sent from the app to Shorebird servers include:
* app_id (specified `shorebird.yaml`)
* channel (optional in `shorebird.yaml`)
* release_version (versionName from AndroidManifest.xml)
* patch_number (generated as part of `shorebird publish`)
* arch (e.g. 'aarch64', needed to send down the right patch)
* platform (e.g. 'android', needed to send down the right patch)
That's it.  The code for this is in `updater/library/src/network.rs`


## Play Store Guidelines

Shorebird is designed to be compatible with the Play Store guidelines. However
Shorebird is a tool, and as with any tool, can be abused.  Deliberately abusing
Shorebird to violate Play Store guidelines is in violation of the Shorebird
[Terms of Service](shorebird.dev/terms.html) and can result in termination of
your account.

Examples of guidelines you should be aware of, include "Deceptive Behavior" and
"Unwanted Software".  Please be clear with your users about what you are
providing with your application and do not violate their expectations with
significant behavioral changes through the use of Shorebird.

Code push services are widely used in the industry (all of the large apps
I'm aware of use them) and there are multiple other code push services
publicly available (e.g. expo.dev & appcenter.ms).  This is a well trodden path.


## Disabling Shorebird

_First, do no harm_

Shorebird is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the stock Flutter engine,
and can be disabled at any time with no affect on your users.

Building with `shorebird build` will include Shorebird code push in your app.
Building with `flutter build --release` will not include Shorebird in your app.
At any time you can simply drop back to `flutter build` and things will work
as they did before.

We have not yet added the ability to delete your account from Shorebird from
the command line, however reach out to us via Discord or email and we are
happy to help you immediately delete your account and disable all updates
for your app(s) deployed with Shorebird.  We anticipate adding this ability
to the command line in the near future.
