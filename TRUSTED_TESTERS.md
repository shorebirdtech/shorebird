# Trusted Testers

While this document is public, access to Shorebird services are not yet
generally available. We're running a trusted tester program with a limited
number of users to ensure that we're building the right thing and that it's
stable for general use.

If you'd like to be a part of the program, please fill out this form:
https://forms.gle/T7x5h5bb6bMBB7hUA

## Welcome!

If you're joining the trusted tester program, welcome! Thank you for your help
making Shorebird a reality.

## Our goal

Our goal with this Trusted Tester program is to shake out bugs and ensure that
we are building things people want. We _want_ your feedback. We _want_ you to
break things. We _want_ you to tell us what you want to see next. We're
already a default-public company, but we intend to be even more open with you
and will be shipping your regular updates during the program, responding to
your feedback.

Filing [issues](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues) is a good way
to provide feedback. Feedback via Discord is also welcome.

Our guiding principle for these early days is "first, do no harm".
It should be the case that using Shorebird is never worse than not using Shorebird.
It is still possible using early versions of Shorebird could break your app in
the wild. If you believe that's the case, please reach out, we're here to help.

## What works today

You can build and deploy new (release) versions of your app to all Android
users via `shorebird` command line from a Mac or Linux host.

All users will synchronously update to the new version on next launch
(no control over this behavior yet,
[issue](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/127)).

Basic access to the updater through package:dart_bindings (unpublished).
https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/tree/main/updater/dart_bindings

Shorebird command line can show a list of what apps and app versions you've
associated with your account and what patches you've pushed to those apps.
https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/tree/main/packages/shorebird_cli

## What doesn't yet

No support for:

- Windows hosts ([issue](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/37))
- Flutter channels (only latest stable 3.7.12 is supported)
- Rollbacks ([issue](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/126))
- Staged rollouts of patches (channels or percentage based) [issue](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/110)
- Async updates / downloads [issue](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/123)
- Analytics
- Web interface
- CI/CD (GitHub Actions, etc.) integration
- Patch signing [issue](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/112)
- Asset changes (images, icons, etc.) [issue](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/318)
- Plugin changes (java, kotlin, etc.) -- currently only supports changing Dart code.

## Installing Shorebird command line

Install the `shorebird` command-line tool by running the following command:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shorebirdtech/install/main/install.sh -sSf | sh
```

This installs `shorebird` into `~/.shorebird/bin` and adds it to your path.
It also installs a copy of Flutter and Dart inside `~/.shorebird/bin/cache/flutter`.
These versions are not intended to be used for development (yet), you can
continue to use the versions of Flutter and Dart you already have installed.

The total install is about 300mb.

More information: https://github.com/shorebirdtech/install/blob/main/README.md

## Using Shorebird code push

If you already have a Flutter app, you can build it with Shorebird in a few steps:

1. The first step is to login. `shorebird login` will prompt you with a Google
   OAuth sign-in link.  Not all `shorebird`
   commands require login, but it's best to just do it first to avoid
   unexpected errors later.

2. Once you're logged in, you can use `shorebird init`. This needs to be run
   within the directory of your Flutter app, it reads and writes your `pubspec.yaml`
   and will write out a new `shorebird.yaml` file.

`shorebird init` does three things:

1. Tells Shorebird that your app exists (e.g. so it can hold patches to it
   and vend them to devices when asked).
2. Creates a `shorebird.yaml` file to your project. `shorebird.yaml` contains
   the app_id for your app, which is the unique identifier the app will send to
   Shorebird servers to identify which application to pull updates for.
3. Finally, `shorebird init` also adds the `shorebird.yaml` to the assets
   section of your `pubspec.yaml` file, ensuring `shorebird.yaml` is bundled
   into your app's assets.

You can go ahead and commit these changes, they will be innocuous even if you
don't end up using Shorebird with this application.

If you don't want to try this on your main application yet, any Flutter app,
including the default Flutter counter works too, e.g.

```
% flutter create shorebird_test
% cd shorebird_test
% shorebird init
? How should we refer to this app? (shorebird_test) shorebird_test
‚úì Initialized Shorebird (38ms)

üê¶ Shorebird initialized successfully!

‚úÖ A shorebird app has been created.
‚úÖ A "shorebird.yaml" has been created.
‚úÖ The "pubspec.yaml" has been updated to include "shorebird.yaml" as an asset.

Reference the following commands to get started:

üöô To run your project use: "shorebird run".
üì¶ To create a new release use: "shorebird release".
üöÄ To push an update use: "shorebird patch".

For more information about Shorebird, visit https://shorebird.dev
```

3.  Typical development usage will involve normal `flutter` commands. Only
    when you go to build the final release version of your app, do you need to use
    the `shorebird` command-line tool.

## Permissions needed for Shorebird

Shorebird code push requires the Network permission to be added to your
`AndroidManifest.xml` file. (Which in Flutter is located in
`android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.) This is required for the
app to be able to communicate with the Shorebird servers to pull new patches.

```xml
<manifest ...>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
    ...
</manifest>
```

Running `shorbird doctor` will check that your `AndroidManifest.xml` file
is set up correctly.

## Shorebird's fork of Flutter

`shorebird` uses a fork of Flutter that includes the Shorebird updater.
This fork is currently based on Flutter 3.7.12.
We replace a few of the Flutter engine files with our own.  To do that, we use
`FLUTTER_STORAGE_BASE_URL` to point to download.shorebird.dev instead of
download.flutter.dev.  We pass through unmodified output from the `flutter`
tool so you will see a warning from Flutter:

```
Flutter assets will be downloaded from http://download.shorebird.dev. Make sure you trust this source!
```

For more information about why we had to fork Flutter see:
[FORKING_FLUTTER.md](FORKING_FLUTTER.md).

## Running your Shorebird-built app

You can use `shorebird run` to build and run your app on a connected
Android device. This is similar to `flutter run --release` just with
Shorebird's fork of the Flutter engine that includes the Shorebird updater.

`shorebird run` wraps `flutter run` and can take any argument `flutter run` can.
To pass arguments to the underlying `flutter run` use a `--` separator. For example:
`shorebird run -- -d my_device` will run on a specific device.

During this trusted tester period, you will likely see several logs from the
shorebird updater. These are for debugging in case you have trouble
and will be removed/silenced in future iterations.

Example:

```
eseidel@erics-mbp test_counter % shorebird run
Running app...
Using hardware rendering with device sdk gphone64 arm64. If you notice graphics artifacts, consider enabling software rendering with "--enable-software-rendering".

E/flutter ( 7283): updater::updater: Problem updating: error sending request for url (https://api.shorebird.dev/api/v1/patches/check): error trying to connect: dns error: failed to lookup address information: No address associated with hostname
```

That indicates you have not yet added the network permissions (see above)
to your app, as I had forgotten when running my example above.

## Creating a release

Before you can start uploading patches, you will need to create a release.
Creating a release builds and submits your app to Shorebird. Shorebird saves the
compiled Dart code from your application in order to make patches smaller in
size.

Example:

```
shorebird release
‚úì Building release (17.9s)
‚úì Fetching apps (0.1s)

What is the version of this release? (0.1.0) 0.1.0

üöÄ Ready to create a new release!

üì± App: shorebird_test (4f636c95-f859-4de3-a730-dde1c099cd53)
üì¶ Release Version: 0.1.0
‚öôÔ∏è  Architecture: aarch64
üïπÔ∏è  Platform: android
#Ô∏è‚É£  Hash: cfe26dddf8aff17131042f9dfad409c83eb130c5a9f2fd6f77325b2388062265

Your next step is to upload the release artifact to the Play Store.
./build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab

See the following link for more information:
https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9859152?hl=en

Would you like to continue? (y/N) Yes
‚úì Fetching releases (55ms)
‚úì Creating release (45ms)
‚úì Creating artifact (1.8s)

‚úÖ Published Release!
```

## Publishing patches to your app

To publish a patch to your app, use `shorebird patch`. It should look like:

```
shorebird patch
‚úì Building patch (16.2s)
‚úì Fetching apps (0.1s)

Which release is this patch for? (0.1.0) 0.1.0

üöÄ Ready to publish a new patch!

üì± App: shorebird_test (4f636c95-f859-4de3-a730-dde1c099cd53)
üì¶ Release Version: 0.1.0
‚öôÔ∏è Architecture: aarch64
üïπÔ∏è Platform: android
üì∫ Channel: stable
#Ô∏è‚É£ Hash: cfe26dddf8aff17131042f9dfad409c83eb130c5a9f2fd6f77325b2388062265

Would you like to continue? (y/N) Yes
‚úì Fetching releases (41ms)
‚úì Fetching release artifact (43ms)
‚úì Downloading release artifact (0.2s)
‚úì Creating diff (0.1s)
‚úì Creating patch (64ms)
‚úì Creating artifact (0.3s)
‚úì Fetching channels (40ms)
‚úì Publishing patch (43ms)

‚úÖ Published Patch!
```

This will generate a new patch for your app and upload it to the Shorebird
servers for distribution to all other copies of your app. For example, you could
try `shorebird run` to run and install your app, and then stop it. Make edits
and `shorebird patch` and then run the app again directly (by clicking on it,
without using `shorebird run`) and you should notice that it updates to the
latest built and published version rather than using the previously installed
version.

The current `shorebird patch` flow is not how we envision Shorebird being used
longer term (e.g one might push a git hash to a CI/CD system, which would then
publish it to Shorebird). However, it's the simplest thing to do for now.

Note that you can only publish a patch to an app that you have already told
shorebird about. This is normally done by `shorebird init` + `shorebird
release`. If needed you can also create an app via `shorebird apps create` and
modify the `shorebird.yaml` directly yourself, see:
https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/tree/main/packages/shorebird_cli#create-app

Your applications in the wild will query for updates with their `app_id` (which
comes from `shorebird.yaml`) and their release version (which comes from
AndroidManifest.xml, which in turn is generated from pubspec.yaml).

## Building a release version of your app

You can use `shorebird build` to build a release version of your app including
the Shorebird updater.

`shorebird build` wraps `flutter build` and can take any argument `flutter build`
can. To pass arguments to the underlying `flutter build` you need
to put `flutter build` arguments _after_ a `--` separator. For example:
`shorebird build -- --dart-define="foo=bar"` will define the "foo" environment
variable inside Dart as you might have done with `flutter build` directly.

Success should look like this:

```
% shorebird build appbundle
‚úì Building shorebird engine (8.0s)
‚úì Building release  (6.4s)
```

## Update behavior

The Shorebird updater is currently hard-coded to update synchronously on
launch. This means that when you push a new version of your app, all users
will update on next launch.

We expect to add more control over update behavior in the future, including
async updates and percentage based rollouts. Please let us know if these
are important to you and we are happy to prioritize them!

The Shorebird updater is designed such that when the network is not available,
or the server is down or otherwise unreachable, the app will continue to run
as normal. Should you ever choose to delete an update from our servers, all your
clients will continue to run as normal.

We have not yet added the ability to rollback patches, but it's on our todo
list and happy to prioritize it if it's important to you. For now, the simplest
thing is to simply push a new patch that reverts the changes you want to undo.

## Play Store

Although Shorebird connects to the network, it does not send any personally
identifiable information. Including Shorebird should not affect your
declarations for the Play Store.

Requests sent from the app to Shorebird servers include:

- app_id (specified `shorebird.yaml`)
- channel (optional in `shorebird.yaml`)
- release_version (versionName from AndroidManifest.xml)
- patch_number (generated as part of `shorebird patch`)
- arch (e.g. 'aarch64', needed to send down the right patch)
- platform (e.g. 'android', needed to send down the right patch)
  That's it. The code for this is in `updater/library/src/network.rs`

## Play Store Guidelines

Shorebird is designed to be compatible with the Play Store guidelines. However
Shorebird is a tool, and as with any tool, can be abused. Deliberately abusing
Shorebird to violate Play Store guidelines is in violation of the Shorebird
[Terms of Service](shorebird.dev/terms.html) and can result in termination of
your account.

Examples of guidelines you should be aware of, include "Deceptive Behavior" and
"Unwanted Software". Please be clear with your users about what you are
providing with your application and do not violate their expectations with
significant behavioral changes through the use of Shorebird.

Code push services are widely used in the industry (all of the large apps
I'm aware of use them) and there are multiple other code push services
publicly available (e.g. expo.dev & appcenter.ms). This is a well trodden path.

## What about iOS?

Current Shorebird is Android-only.  We have plans to add iOS, but not yet
implemented.  Using Shorebird for your Android builds does not affect
your iOS builds.  You can successfully ship a Shorebird-built appbundle
to Google Play and contintue to ship a Flutter-built ipa to the App Store.
The difference will be that you will be able to update your Android users
sooner than you will your iOS users for now.

## Disabling Shorebird

_First, do no harm_

Shorebird is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the stock Flutter engine,
and can be disabled at any time with no effect on your users.

Building with `shorebird build` will include Shorebird code push in your app.
Building with `flutter build --release` will not include Shorebird in your app.
At any time you can simply drop back to `flutter build` and things will work
as they did before.

We have not yet added the ability to delete your account from Shorebird from
the command line, however reach out to us via Discord or email and we are
happy to help you immediately delete your account and disable all updates
for your app(s) deployed with Shorebird. We anticipate adding this ability
to the command line in the near future.

You can remove `shorebird` from your path by removing it from your `.bashrc` or
`.zshrc` and deleting the `.shorebird` directory located in `~/.shorebird`.


# Release Notes

This section contains past updates we've sent to current Trusted Testers.

## Announcement for 0.0.7

We've just released Shorebird CLI v0.0.7 üéâ 

What's new:
* Fixed our backend to not error for large app releases.
* `shorebird build` is now split into two subcommands:
  * `shorebird build apk` (new)
  * `shorebird build appbundle` (previously `shorebird build`)

Changelog: https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/releases/tag/v0.0.7 


## Announcement for 0.0.6

We're happy to announce Shorebird 0.0.6!

Shorebird should be ready for production apps < 10k users.

You should be able to get test latest via `shorebird upgrade`

What's new:
* Fixed updates to apply when app installed with apk splits (as the Play
  Store does by default). This was our last known production blocking issue.
* `shorebird subscription cancel` now is able to cancel your monthly
  Shorebird subscription.  Your Shorebird account will keep working until
  the end of your billing period.  After expiration, your apps will continue
  to function normally, just will no longer pull updates from Shorebird.
* `shorebird cache clean` (Thanks @TypicalEgg!) will now clear Shorebird
  caches.
* Install script now pulls down artifacts as part of install.
* Continued improvements to our account handling in preparation for supporting
  self-signup.

Known issues:
* Shorebird is still using Flutter 3.7.10.  We will update to 3.7.11 right
  after this release:
  https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/305
* Shorebird does not yet support Android versionCode, only versionName.
  https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/291

Please try shorebird in production and let us know how we can help!

Eric


## Announcement for 0.0.5

We're happy to announce Shorebird 0.0.5!

TL;DR: Shorebird should be ready for use in production for apps < 10k users.

You should be able to get the latest via `shorebird upgrade`.

What's new:
* Updates should now apply consistently (previously sometimes failed).
https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/235.  This was our
last-known production-blocking issue.
* `shorebird doctor` and other commands now are a bit more robust in
their checks.
* We did a ton of backend work (which shouldn't be visible), mostly
in terms of testing to make sure we're ready for production.  We also
integrated our backend with Stripe (to make subscription management
possible).

Known issues:
* Shorebird is still using Flutter 3.7.10.  We will update to 3.7.11
in the next couple days.  We've done the previous Flutter updates
manually, but we're working on automating updates so that Shorebird
can track Flutter versions as soon as minutes after they are released.
https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/236

You can see what we're tracking for 0.0.6 here:
https://github.com/orgs/shorebirdtech/projects/6/views/1

We've also wired up Stripe integration on the backend and will have some
subscription management (including ability to cancel) in our next release.

We expect you all will have requests as you try Shorebird in production
please don't hesitate to let us know!  We're standing by to fix/add what
you need to help you be successful.

Please try shorebird in production and let us know how we can help!

Eric



## Announcement for 0.0.4

I'm happy to announce shorebird 0.0.4!

This one's a big one.  Unfortunately it's also breaking.

You will both need to re-install shorebird and re-login to shorebird:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.shorebird
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shorebirdtech/install/main/install.sh -sSf | sh
```

Then you'll want to `shorebird login` and follow the prompts to authenticate
with a Google account.

We believe we've updated our database to mark all trusted testers as paid
accounts after the auth migration, but if you see any issues, please let us
know, and we'll be happy to fix your account right away.

What's new:
* `shorebird` supports Android 32-bit and 64-bit devices!
* `shorebird` works on Linux and Mac-Intel hosts!
* `shorebird login` uses Google OAuth instead of API keys.
* `shorebird doctor` does some basic validation.
* `shorebird account` shows your login status.
* Updated to Flutter 3.7.10.
* We also automated our builds of the Shorebird engine.
  While that won't affect your usage, it did make this release
  possible and will allow us to keep up to date with Flutter more easily as
  well as removing a source of human error in our processes.

As part of adding support for Android arm32 devices as well as Linux and
Mac-Intel hosts, we've changed how `shorebird` uses Flutter.  Previously it used
the Flutter SDK already installed on your machine.  Now it brings its own copy
of `flutter`.  This is due to the fact that our previous method of replacing the
Flutter engine binaries on Android went in through a (hacky) development-only
path, which only supported only a single architecture at a time (hence us
previously limiting `shorebird` only 64-bit Android devices).

Now we use a fork of Flutter.  The only change in our fork is the engine version
it tries to fetch.  When `shorebird` runs our forked `flutter`, we also tell it
to fetch its engine artifacts from our server (download.shorebird.dev) instead
of Google's (download.flutter.io).  download.shorebird.dev knows how to replace
a few Android artifacts with Shorebird enabled ones and proxy all other requests
to Google's servers.  This is how we now support all platforms Flutter does
since it's using the same host binaries as an unmodified Flutter SDK.

https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/blob/main/FORKING_FLUTTER.md has more
information on how we forked Flutter if you're curious.

Known issues:
* We have had reports of patches sometimes failing to apply.  We expect to have
  a fix for this early next week.
  https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/235
* Shorebird itself should work on Windows, but we haven't updated our installer
  script to support it yet.  https://github.com/shorebirdtech/install/issues/10

Please try out the new platforms and new auth flow and let us know what you
think.
