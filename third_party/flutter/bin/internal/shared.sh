# Waits for an update lock to be acquired.
#
# To ensure that we don't simultaneously update Dart in multiple parallel
# instances, we try to obtain an exclusive lock on this file descriptor (and
# thus this script's source file) while we are updating Dart and compiling the
# script. To do this, we try to use the command line program "flock", which is
# available on many Unix-like platforms, in particular on most Linux
# distributions. You give it a file descriptor, and it locks the corresponding
# file, having inherited the file descriptor from the shell.
#
# Complicating matters, there are two major scenarios where this will not
# work.
#
# The first is if the platform doesn't have "flock", for example on macOS. There
# is not a direct equivalent, so on platforms that don't have flock, we fall
# back to using trying to use the shlock command, and if that doesn't exist,
# then we use mkdir as an atomic operation to create a lock directory. If mkdir
# is able to create the directory, then the lock is acquired. To determine if we
# have "flock" or "shlock" available, we use the "hash" shell built-in.
#
# The second complication is on network file shares. On NFS, to obtain an
# exclusive lock you need a file descriptor that is open for writing. Thus, we
# ignore errors from flock by redirecting all output to /dev/null, since users
# will typically not care about errors from flock and are more likely to be
# confused by them than helped. The "shlock" method doesn't work for network
# shares, since it is PID-based. The "mkdir" method does work over NFS
# implementations that support atomic directory creation (which is most of
# them). The "schlock" and "flock" commands are more reliable than the mkdir
# method, however, or we would use mkdir in all cases.
#
# The upgrade_shorebird function calling _wait_for_lock is executed in a subshell
# with a redirect that pipes the source of this script into file descriptor 7.
# A flock lock is released when this subshell exits and file descriptor 7 is
# closed. The mkdir lock is released via an exit trap from the subshell that
# deletes the lock directory.
