# This script tests the patching functionality of Shorebird.
# It creates a new empty, flutter project, initializes Shorebird,
# creates a new release, patches the release, and then ensures
# that the patch was applied correctly.
#
# Pre-requisites:
# - Flutter must be installed.
# - Android SDK must be installed.
# - ADB must be installed and be part of PATH.
# - Android emulator must be running.
# - Shorebird must be installed.
#
# Usage: ./patch_e2e.sh
