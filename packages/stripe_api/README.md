A Dart library for interacting with [Stripe](https://stripe.com).

Built with 💙 by [Shorebird][shorebird_link].

## About

This is just enough of the Stripe API to implement what Shorebird needs.

We built this after failing to find a good server-side Stripe package for Dart.

It certainly could be expanded to support more of the Stripe API.

Currently hand-rolled, but we could consider generating it from
Stripe's OpenAPI spec in the future.

This is not currently published on pub, just developed in the open in hopes of
saving someone else time.
