A Dart library for interacting with [Stripe](https://stripe.com).

Built with 💙 by [Shorebird][shorebird_link].

## About

This is just enough of the Stripe API to implement what Shorebird needs.

We built this after failing to find a good server-side Stripe package for Dart.

It certainly could be expanded to support more of the Stripe API.

Currently hand-rolled, but we could consider generating it from
Stripe's OpenAPI spec in the future.

This is not currently published on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev), just developed in the open in hopes of
saving someone else time.
