The ipa files in this folder were generated by building the stock Flutter counter app with `shorebird build ipa`.

Some of their contents has been removed to reduce the size of the files. All .dylib files have been removed.

Files: 
- base.ipa is meant to represent an ipa uploaded as part of a release.
- no_version.ipa is base.ipa with the version info removed from the Info.plist, along with several other files to save space.
- no_plist.ipa is base.ipa with the Info.plist (and many other parts) removed.
