The ipa files in this folder were generated by building the stock Flutter counter app with `shorebird build ipa`.

Some of their contents has been removed to reduce the size of the files. All .dylib files have been removed.

Files:

- base.ipa is meant to represent an ipa uploaded as part of a release. App.framework/App and Flutter.framework/Flutter have been removed to save space.
- no_version.ipa an .ipa with the version info removed from the Info.plist, along with several other files to save space.
- no_plist.ipa an .ipa with the Info.plist (and many other parts) removed.
- app_file_space.ipa is an .ipa with a space in the .app file name.
- asset_changes.ipa is built from the same codebase as base.ipa with a change made to one of the assets. App.framework/App and Flutter.framework/Flutter have been removed to save space.
- dart_changes.ipa is built from the same codebase as base.ipa with a change made to the dart code. App.framework/App and Flutter.framework/Flutter have been removed to save space.
