The aab files in this folder were generated by building a flutter module with
`flutter build aar --no-debug --no-profile`.

Some of their contents has been removed to reduce the size of the files. Most notably, x86_64 and armeabi-v7a libapp.so files have been removed.

Files: 
- base.aar is meant to represent an aar uploaded as part of a release.
- changed_dart.aar was built from the same code as base.aar with only Dart changes (i.e., no asset changes)
- changed_asset.aar was built from the same code as base.aar with only asset changes (i.e., no Dart changes)
- changed_dart_and_asset.aar was built from the same code as base.aar with both Dart and asset changes
