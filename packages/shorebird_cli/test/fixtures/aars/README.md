The aab files in this folder were generated by building a flutter module with
`flutter build aar --no-debug --no-profile`.

- base.aar is meant to represent an aar uploaded as part of a release.
- changed_dart.aar was built from the same code as base.aar with only Dart changes (i.e., no asset changes)
- changed_asset.aar was built from the same code as base.aar with only asset changes (i.e., no Dart changes)
- changed_dart_and_asset.aar was built from the same code as base.aar with both Dart and asset changes
