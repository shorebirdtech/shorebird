# Shorebird CLI

**üöß This project is under heavy development üöß**

**‚ùóÔ∏è Currently, only Android arm64 release builds are supported but we are working on expanding to other platforms/architectures.**

The Shorebird command-line allows developers to interact with various Shorebird services. We're currently focusing on CodePush but the Shorebird CLI will continue to expand as we add more capabilities.

## Installing

```sh
dart pub global activate --source git https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird --git-path packages/shorebird_cli
```

## Commands

### Login

Get started by requesting an API key and using `shorebird login` to authenticate:

```bash
shorebird login
```

**Sample**

```bash
shorebird login
? Please enter your API Key: <API-KEY>
‚úì Logging into shorebird.dev (7ms)
You are now logged in.
```

### Logout

To sign out and remove an existing session, use the `shorebird logout` command:

```bash
shorebird logout
```

**Sample**

```bash
shorebird logout
‚úì Logging out of shorebird.dev (1ms)
```

### Run

Run an existing application using the Shorebird Engine via the `shorebird run` command:

```bash
shorebird run
```

**‚ùóÔ∏èNote**: If it's the first time, `shorebird run` will download and build the shorebird engine which may take some time. The shorebird engine will be cached for subsequent runs.

### Build

Build a new release of your application using the `shorebird build` command:

```bash
shorebird build
```

### Publish

The publish command allows developers to publish new releases of their Flutter application to the Shorebird CodePush API. These updates are then pushed directly to users' devices.

```bash
# Publish the default release
shorebird publish

# Publish a specific release
shorebird publish <path/to/libapp.so>
```
