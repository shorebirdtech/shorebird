# Shorebird CLI

**🚧 This project is under heavy development 🚧**

**❗️ Currently, only Android arm64 release builds are supported but we are working on expanding to other platforms/architectures.**

The Shorebird command-line allows developers to interact with various Shorebird services. We're currently focusing on CodePush but the Shorebird CLI will continue to expand as we add more capabilities.

## Installing

```sh
# Clone Shorebird
git clone https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird

# Activate the Shorebird CLI
dart pub global activate --source path shorebird/packages/shorebird_cli
```

## Commands

### Init

Get started by initializing shorebird in your current project.

```bash
# 1. Creates a new app (if one doesn't exist) with a stable channel.
# 2. Generates a shorebird.yaml (if one doesn't exist).
# 3. Adds the shorebird.yaml to the pubspec.yaml flutter assets.
shorebird init
```

**Sample**

```
shorebird init
✓ Initialized Shorebird (27ms)

🐦 Shorebird initialized successfully!

✅ A shorebird app has been created.
✅ A "shorebird.yaml" has been created.
✅ The "pubspec.yaml" has been updated to include "shorebird.yaml" as an asset.

Reference the following commands to get started:

🚙 To run your project use: "shorebird run".
📦 To build your project use: "shorebird build".
🚀 To publish a new update use: "shorebird publish".

```

### Login

Request an API key and use `shorebird login` to authenticate:

```bash
shorebird login
```

**Sample**

```
shorebird login
? Please enter your API Key: <API-KEY>
✓ Logging into shorebird.dev (7ms)
You are now logged in.
```

### Logout

To sign out and remove an existing session, use the `shorebird logout` command:

```bash
shorebird logout
```

**Sample**

```
shorebird logout
✓ Logging out of shorebird.dev (1ms)
```

### Create App

To create an app use the `shorebird apps create` command. An app id can be specified as a CLI option but shorebird will default to the `app_id` defined in the `shorebird.yaml`

```bash
# Create an app using default app id
shorebird apps create

# Create an app using an explicit app id
shorebird apps create --app-id "my-app-id"
```

**Sample**

```
shorebird apps create
? Enter the App ID (default_id) my_app_id
Created new app: my_app_id
```

### Delete App

To delete an existing app on Shorebird, use the `shorebird apps delete` command. An app-id can be specified as a CLI option but shorebird will default to the app_id defined in the `shorebird.yaml`

```bash
# Create an app using default app id
shorebird apps delete

# Create an app using an explicit app id
shorebird apps delete --app-id "my-app-id"
```

**Sample**

```
shorebird apps delete
? Enter the App ID (default_id) my_app_id
Deleting an app is permanent. Continue? (y/N) Yes
Deleted app: my_app_id
```

### List Apps

List all existing apps in Shorebird using the `shorebird apps list` command:

```bash
shorebird apps list
```

**Sample**

```
shorebird apps list
my_counter: v1.0.0 (patch #1)
my_example: v2.1.0 (patch #2)
```

### Run

Run an existing application using the Shorebird Engine via the `shorebird run` command:

```bash
shorebird run
```

**❗️Note**: If it's the first time using shorebird, `shorebird run` will download and build the shorebird engine which may take some time. The shorebird engine will be cached for subsequent runs.

### Build

Build a new release of your application using the `shorebird build` command:

```bash
shorebird build
```

**❗️Note**: If it's the first time using shorebird, `shorebird build` will download and build the shorebird engine which may take some time. The shorebird engine will be cached for subsequent runs.

### Publish

The publish command allows developers to publish new releases of their Flutter application to the Shorebird CodePush API. These updates are then pushed directly to users' devices.

```bash
# Publish the artifacts
# 1. Builds the artifacts (equivalent to a shorebird build)
# 2. Creates a new app if one does not exist
# 3. Creates a release if one does not exist
# 4. Creates a new patch if one does not exist
# 5. Uploads the artifacts as part of the patch
# 6. Promotes the patch as "stable"
shorebird publish
```

**Sample**

```
shorebird publish
✓ Building release (5.5s)
✓ Fetching apps (0.2s)
