### Environment setup

Working on Shorebird requires Dart and Rust.

Once both are installed, `./scripts/bootstrap.sh` will run `pub get` all
packages in the repository.

### Running tests

We don't yet have a script to run tests locally. For now, we recommend using
`very_good test -r` in the packages directory to run all shorebird tests.

(If you run it in the root, it will find packages in bin/cache/flutter and try
to run tests there, some of which will fail.)

To generate a coverage report install `lcov`:

```
brew install lcov
```

Then run tests with the `--coverage` flag:

```
very_good test -r --coverage
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage
```

You can view the generated coverage report via:

```
open coverage/index.html
```

### Tracking coverage

The following command will generate a coverage report for the Dart packages:

```bash
dart test --coverage=coverage && dart pub global run coverage:format_coverage --lcov --in=coverage --out=coverage/lcov.info --packages=.dart_tool/package_config.json --check-ignore
```

Coverage reports are uploaded to [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/shorebirdtech/shorebird).
