## Status

We're in the process of converting the quick demos written by one person, into a
multi-contributor project usable by others. Previous demo code can be found at:
https://github.com/shorebirdtech/old_repo

## Getting Started

Refer to [shorebird/install](https://github.com/shorebirdtech/install) for installation instructions.

## Packages

This repository is a monorepo containing the following packages:

### Environment setup

Working on Shorebird requires Dart and Rust.

We currently assume the Dart from the Flutter SDK on the 'stable' channel. Due
to the way the Dart compiler works, Shorebird requires an exact version of
Flutter/Dart to operate correctly today.

We currently assume Rust 1.67.0 or later, although the code is unlikely to be
sensitive to the exact version of Rust.

Once both are installed, `./scripts/bootstrap.sh` will run `pub get`
and `cargo check` for all packages in the repository.

### Running tests

We don't yet have a script to run tests locally. For now, you can run tests
manually by running `cargo test` in a Rust package directory or `dart test` in
a Dart package directory.
