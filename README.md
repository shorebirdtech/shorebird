### Environment setup

Working on Shorebird requires Dart and Rust.

Once both are installed, `./scripts/bootstrap.sh` will run `pub get` all
packages in the repository.

### Running tests

We don't yet have a script to run tests locally. For now, we recommend using
`very_good test -r` in the packages directory to run all shorebird tests.

(If you run it in the root, it will find packages in bin/cache/flutter and try
to run tests there, some of which will fail.)

### Tracking coverage

The following command will generate a coverage report for the Dart packages:

```bash
dart test --coverage=coverage && dart pub global run coverage:format_coverage --lcov --in=coverage --out=coverage/lcov.info --packages=.dart_tool/package_config.json --check-ignore
```

We don't yet have a recommended way to view the coverage report but there are
several extensions available in VSCode.
